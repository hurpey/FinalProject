The Influence of Social and Demographic factors on household income in the United States of America (USA).

**Reason this Topic was Selected**

Rising economic inequality in the United States has been a topic of debate and concern in recent times. The purpose of this analysis is to determine how various social and demographic factors affect household income levels among counties in the USA. Factors considered include age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, employment status, occupation, household and living arrangements, and education level.

**Questions to be answered with this analysis**

Using county level data mostly obtained from the USA Census Bureau, this analysis aims to answer the following questions:

- Which county records the highest level of income and lowest level of income?
- Which ethnicities are in the highest and lowest income quintiles?
- Is there any increase in income level as educational attainment increases?
- Is there a variance in household income based on the age of the person who heads the household?
